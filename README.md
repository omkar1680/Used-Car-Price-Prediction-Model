# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Model

Overview:

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, mileage, engine size, and accident history. It leverages advanced regression models like LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost, with hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. The project includes extensive feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, and performance evaluation to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.


Features:

Advanced Regression Models: Uses LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost for prediction.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Implements Optuna for tuning model parameters.
Cross-Validation: Uses KFold Cross-Validation to ensure model robustness.
Feature Engineering: Generates new features such as vehicle age, power-to-weight ratio, and mileage per year.
Real-World Dataset: The dataset includes real-world car attributes like brand, model, mileage, and accident history.


Technologies Used:

Python 3.x, 

Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Seaborn for visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities.
LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost for regression models.
